# The mpax235 Web Server
A work in progress web server. Windows-exclusive for now, I'll hopefully add support for Linux soon.

**Warning:** This is not recommended for production use yet. There might be some bugs. Once this is finished, it will be recommended for production use.

# Building
**Note: This requires a Windows system.**
Run the `build.bat` script, if everything went well, you should see the `mpax235.exe` file in the directory where your `mpax235.cpp` file is located. (Requires the Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022)
